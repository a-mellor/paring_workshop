# What is it?

Started at [Spa Conference 2018](https://spaconference.org/spa2018/sessions/session809.html) [pairing workshop](https://spaconference.org/spa2018/sessions/session809.html) run by folks at [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov).

A basic ruby / rspec project setup and ready to go.

# Instructions

Write a programme that simulates ‘rock paper scissors’ 

## Rules:
Each player chooses one of Rock, Paper, Scissors. When both have selected the following rules are applied to determine the winner:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock
* Same move is a draw

Start by implementing the logic. If you get chance you can extend the programme by making it interactive and adding a UI


# Use it

Clone the repository.

Bundle.

Run `bin/rspec` - you should get "No examples found".

Start writing your code.
